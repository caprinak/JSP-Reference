The JSP development environment provides a means for generating HTML pages
dynamically with server-side Java programming. The syntax allows most of the
HTML to be coded directly, with sections marked off for Java code that controls
the page generation. There is support for including other resources, both static and
dynamic. JavaBeans are fully integrated into the framework, and custom tags allow
functionality to be encapsulated and made available to nonexpert page authors.
The key point this chapter makes is this: a mental model of the JSP development
cycle is crucial to understanding how to create and debug Web applications. Knowledge
of what happens at translation time (static resources are included via the <%@ include
%> directive, for example) versus request time (dynamic request dispatching with
<jsp:include>) provides insight into which features to use and when to use them.
